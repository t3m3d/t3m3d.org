Case 7.1: Great Alaska Adventures
The task at hand for Great Alaska Adventures, which will be referred to as GAA, is to organize and lead a fly-fishing expedition that will last for five days. This adventure will wind down the Tikchik River system in Alaska for the top management team of BlueNote, Inc (Larson, 2024). The adventure has been scheduled to start on June twenty first and end on June twenty fifth. The expedition has been assigned a budget of forty-five thousand dollars.
	GAA will be providing an extensive package of extras to go with the expedition. This is to include flights to and from the assigned base camps. They will also provide drift boats for transportation via the river. Accommodations, food and water, instruction on how to fly-fish, guides, and licenses to fish will also be provided where they are needed. The expedition is to be executed in accordance with applicable laws and regulations in the State of Alaska. This is to ensure that all attendees of the expedition stay safe and enjoy the trip.
The expedition is set up to offer the BlueNote management team a unique and exciting opportunity. There will be certain limitations and exclusions to what is included in the expedition package. For instance, arrangements for travel to and from Dillingham, the guests’ fly-fishing equipment, and their clothing will be a responsibility of the guests. On another note, air travel in the local area, to and from the base camps will be outsourced from other companies.
GAA is committed to the creation of a safe environment for the expedition as well as an enjoyable experience for all guests. It is important to mention that an expedition in nature is prone to risks and these risks should be considered before the event. These risks can include adverse weather conditions, equipment failures, or wildlife encounters. GAA will take steps to mitigate these risks and ensure the safety of all guests.
The risk management process for the Alaska Fly-Fishing Expedition will involve several key steps:
The first step is to identify potential risks associated with the expedition is risk identification (SafetyCulture, 2023). This could include risks related to weather, transportation, wildlife, equipment, safety, and guest satisfaction. Some specific examples might include:
•	Extreme weather conditions such as storms, high winds, or cold temperatures could impact the expedition schedule or the safety of the guests.
•	Delays or cancellations of flights or boat transportation could disrupt the itinerary there are many factors that can affect the transportation aspect such as health issues with riders or sever weather concerns.
•	 Encounters with bears, moose, or other wildlife are common in nature and pose a potential safety risk to guests.
•	Equipment failures or malfunctions could jeopardize the expedition. Preventive maintenance will be performed regularly, but potential failure should still be considered.
•	Accidents or injuries could occur, potentially leading to legal or financial consequences which equal time and money.
•	Guests may have unrealistic expectations or become dissatisfied with the accommodations, food, or activities, so it is important that we make the guests always feel special.
Once risks have been identified through the risk identification phase, it comes time to assess those potential risks the assessment will help us to determine the potential impact and likelihood of these risks becoming a reality. This can be done using a risk matrix or other quantitative methods (Team, n.d.). A major natural disaster would be an example of a high-impact yet low-probability risk. While natural disaster is a high-impact low-probability risk something like equipment malfunction is a low-impact, high-probability risk.
GAA will develop appropriate risk response strategies. These strategies could include:
•	Risk avoidance through Eliminating or avoiding the risk altogether. For example, if the risk of encountering bears is deemed too high, GAA could choose to avoid certain areas or provide additional safety measures.
•	Risk reduction involves the minimization of the likelihood of the risk. This could involve implementing safety protocols, keeping spare equipment, or training staff on risk response (The Investopedia Team, 2024).
•	Risk transfer involves the shifting the risk to a third party, which could be accomplished through purchasing insurance and turning in any trouble into the insurance company (CFI Team, 2023).
•	Risk Acceptance consists of accepting the risk and taking no action. This might be appropriate for low-impact, low-probability risks (CSPO, 2022).
The risk management process is not a one-time event. GAA will continue to monitor risks throughout the expedition and take corrective action as needed. This may involve updating risk assessments, implementing new risk response strategies, or adjusting the expedition plan (Kadar, 2022).
By following a systematic risk management process, GAA can help to identify and mitigate potential risks, ensuring a safe and successful expedition for the BlueNote management team.
Potential Risks for the Alaska Fly-Fishing Expedition
1.	Extreme weather conditions, such as storms, heavy rain, or unexpected cold spurts, could disrupt the expedition's schedule, create safety hazards, or affect fishing conditions.
2.	Equipment malfunctions or breakdowns of essential equipment, such as boats, fishing gear, or camping supplies, could jeopardize the expedition's success and potentially lead to delays or cancellations.
3.	Encounters with dangerous wildlife, particularly bears or moose, could pose a significant threat to the safety of participants.
4.	Participants may experience health problems, such as altitude sickness, seasickness, or injuries, which could require medical attention and potentially disrupt the expedition.
5.	Unforeseen costs, such as emergency medical expenses, equipment replacements, or unexpected transportation charges, could exceed the project's budget.
