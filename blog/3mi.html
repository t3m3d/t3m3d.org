      <h5>9/21/24 | Microsoft is rumored to be reopening a nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania to power it's artificial intelligence datacenter.</h5>
      <div class="fakeimg" style="height:350px;width:600px;"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A9OS3IDb8nE?si=fy-dVah7cs28owB7" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div> 
      <p>Almost every night I watch some YouTube when I lay down. Sometimes I may watch a movie then pray and go to sleep. It is a simple pleasure of mine. I have a group of channels that I commonly watch that includes @TechLinked, the video I have embedded above introduces Microsoft's idea of opening the power plant back up. In 1979, 3 Mile Island had a massive meltdown. It is one of the worst nuclear accidents to ever happen inside of the United States. The meltdown of Three Mile Island's reactor resulted in the release of radioactive gases and iodine into the environment. The accident has been rated as a Level 5 event on the International Nuclear Event Scale. With this being said, I believe there will be activists protesting the reopening of the power plant and at the same time experts and professionals of the nuclear field have gained understanding of how the event happened and technology has progressed to prevent such events from happening again.</p>
      <p>Looking at the World's history with cyber warfare on nuclear energy, it is important that cybersecurity is considered in the event of reopening this plant. Some readers may be aware of past attacks that were speculated to be conducted by nation states, namely Stuxnet. Stuxnet was rumored to be an operation laid out by The US Central Intelligence Agency. I will cover <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet">Stuxnet</a> further in my next entry, but Stuxnet to my knowledge the most potentially deadly acts of cyberwarfare to date. The worm was injected into an Iranian Nuclear Plant targeting programmable logic controllers. A computer worm is a virus that distributes itself to multiple devices on a network without the need for human intervention. Stuxnet changed the speeds of the nuclear centerfuges causing failure in almost one-fifth of the effected centerfuges.</p>
